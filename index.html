  <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    DualThreads (the “App”) uses the Meta Threads API to support <strong>automated posting, reply management, and insights retrieval</strong> for the operator’s Threads account(s). This Privacy Policy explains how data is collected, used, stored, and protected by the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect and Handle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Content Data</strong>: post text, reply text, content IDs, parent/child relation IDs, timestamps.</li>
    <li><strong>Insights / Metrics</strong>: impressions, likes, replies, reposts, quotes, and other analytics available via the Threads API.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Data</strong>: OAuth access/refresh tokens, execution and error logs, IP address, and similar data processed for security and operation.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational Data</strong>: posting schedules, drafts, and data stored in connected tools (e.g., Google Sheets) for operation of the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use the Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and manage posts and replies on Threads (including automation).</li>
    <li>Retrieve and analyze insights for operational reporting and performance measurement.</li>
    <li>Improve service quality, troubleshoot issues, ensure security, and comply with applicable laws and platform policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes above. By default, we keep data for up to <strong>12 months</strong>, unless a longer period is required by law or legitimate record-keeping obligations. Data that is no longer needed will be deleted without undue delay.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share personal data with third parties, except with trusted processors necessary to operate the App (e.g., Google Apps Script / Google Sheets, hosting providers). Such processors handle data under appropriate confidentiality and security obligations. We may also disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or security.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access tokens are stored in secure storage under access control (e.g., Google Apps Script Properties).</li>
    <li>Principle of least privilege, rate limiting, and audit of access/activity logs.</li>
    <li>Transport security via HTTPS and timely remediation of known vulnerabilities in dependencies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You may request <strong>access, correction, restriction, or deletion</strong> of data that the App controls. Please see our <a href="./data-deletion.html">Data Deletion</a> page for the procedure. We will respond within a reasonable time and in accordance with applicable law and platform rules.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>

    The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If we learn that such data has been inadvertently processed, we will delete it promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date above. Material changes will be communicated by reasonable means.
